For this project we will be using a dataset from a US-based organization called Yelp, which provides a platform for users to provide reviews and rate their interactions with a variety of organizations – businesses, restaurants, health clubs, hospitals, local governmental offices, charitable organizations, etc. Yelp has made a portion of this data available for personal, educational, and academic purposes.

The original information can be found at:

The main idea of this project is to answer some questions from the data using SQL that lead to useful information. This is a 2-part project. In the first part, Ther is a series of questions that will help us profile and understand the data. In the second part of the assignment, we are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. We will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. For both parts of this project, we will use "Data Analysis Yelp" as worksheet. It provides all the questions we are going to ask, and our job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet.
